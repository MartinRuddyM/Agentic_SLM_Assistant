  Given this paragraph:

  Fashion is a powerful form of expression, where a designer uses fabric, color, and texture to build a unique vision. Every fabric chosen must connect with the idea, allowing the garment to reflect mood, time, and emotion. A designer often starts with a concept, shaping each color and texture to fit a theme. Fashion depends on detail; the texture of a material, the depth of a color, and the structure of a fabric all work together to create impact. In every collection, a designer aims to tell a story through fabric and color, letting fashion move beyond simple clothing into art. Texture plays a key role, giving fashion both physical feeling and visual emotion. Strong fashion relies not just on the outer look, but also on the deep connection between designer, fabric, color, and vision.
