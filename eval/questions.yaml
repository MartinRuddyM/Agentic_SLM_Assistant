code_2: 'Given this paragraph:


  Fashion is a powerful form of expression, where a designer uses fabric, color, and
  texture to build a unique vision. Every fabric chosen must connect with the idea,
  allowing the garment to reflect mood, time, and emotion. A designer often starts
  with a concept, shaping each color and texture to fit a theme. Fashion depends on
  detail; the texture of a material, the depth of a color, and the structure of a
  fabric all work together to create impact. In every collection, a designer aims
  to tell a story through fabric and color, letting fashion move beyond simple clothing
  into art. Texture plays a key role, giving fashion both physical feeling and visual
  emotion. Strong fashion relies not just on the outer look, but also on the deep
  connection between designer, fabric, color, and vision.
