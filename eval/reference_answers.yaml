  As of April 2025, the President of Nepal is Ram Chandra Paudel, who assumed office on 13 March 2023. A veteran of Nepalese politics, Paudel has been a prominent figure in the Nepali Congress party for decades. His political journey began in the early 1960s when he joined movements opposing the Panchayat system, leading to multiple imprisonments totaling over 15 years. Paudel was a founding member of the Nepal Students Union in 1970 and steadily rose through the party ranks. He was first elected to Parliament in 1991 and served in various capacities, including Speaker of the House of Representatives (1994–1999), Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (1999–2002), and Minister for Peace and Reconstruction (2007–2008). Despite facing setbacks, such as losing the prime ministerial election in 2010 after 17 rounds of voting, Paudel remained a steadfast advocate for democracy and peace. His election as the third President of Nepal marked the culmination of a political career spanning over six decades .​

  Over the past two decades, native plant species in Albufera Natural Park have adapted to increasing salinity levels through various physiological and ecological mechanisms. In salt marsh areas, succulent plants like cordgrass (Spartina spp.) and saltwort (Salsola spp.) have thrived by developing salt-excreting glands and water-storing tissues, enabling them to survive in high-salinity conditions. These halophytic adaptations allow them to maintain cellular function despite osmotic stress. Additionally, the park's vegetation includes species such as dune grass, mastic, and myrtle, which are adapted to the coastal dunes and Mediterranean forest ecosystems. The dynamic interplay between freshwater inflows from rivers and increasing salinity due to sea-level rise and reduced freshwater inputs has led to shifts in plant community compositions, favoring salt-tolerant species. Conservation efforts, including the creation of reserves for endangered species like the samaruc fish and the white water lily, aim to preserve the park's biodiversity amid these changing conditions.

  DeepSeek V1 is a text-only model, meaning it cannot work directly with images as input or output. It was designed specifically for natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, and basic reasoning over text and structured data.

  At the time of DeepSeek V1’s release, multimodal capabilities — the ability to process images, video, or audio alongside text — were not yet part of its architecture. DeepSeek focused on building a strong foundation in text understanding first.

  However, later versions of DeepSeek (like DeepSeek-VL and DeepSeek-R1) started to introduce multimodal abilities. These newer models are designed to handle both text and images, allowing for tasks like visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, and grounded text generation based on visual inputs.

  So, if you specifically need a model that works with images, you would want to look at a later DeepSeek version, or alternatively consider multimodal models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V (Vision) or Google’s Gemini family.
