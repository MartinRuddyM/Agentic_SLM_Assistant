  EXAMPLE USER QUESTIONS:
  I am doing a project with AutoCAD. How can I copy an existant line and paste it in parallel with sale of 2x?
  
  The program is not letting me fill an area with colour.
  
  Okay, so I closed the line and now it is working, thank you. Now let's work on another project writing my kitchen book. Can you expand on the idea of desset recipies made of wild berries from Germany?
  
  What program can I use to add photos into the book's chapters?
  
  How to increase the length of inserted photos.
  
  Increase brightness and edit with some template. Have any template ideas?
  
  Oh yes, I meant filters instead of templates. Then which filters would you recommend?
  
  Allright, I tried a few and now I found a good one. Now tell me, is there any more advanced software that I can use to edit the images? This seems a bit too basic.
  
  I can't install the software needed for the image, it says: Software not commpatible with your system.
  
  I checked the setting and I am running on Windows 64 bits.
  
  Okay how can I share the current version of the work? My niece is coming tomorrow and I want to show her in advance, she really likes photography.
  
  I tried the share button but it's now working. Should I try with my Gmail account instead of Facebook?
  
  Thank you
